    <p>
      The main point of this Italian meatball-inspired meatloaf is to show you
      what happens when you make meatloaf like your grandparents did. During the
      Great Depression, this type of dish was a popular strategy for stretching
      what little meat you had into as filling a meal as possible.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups very dry white bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 cups tomato sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
          baking dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat olive oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high
          heat. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil and butter until
          onion is golden brown and soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute
          until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and cool
          onion mixture to room temperature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add milk and stir with a fork
          until combined. Let sit until all of the milk is absorbed into the
          breadcrumbs, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine ground chuck, cooled onion mixture, parsley, Parmesan cheese,
          eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl.
          Grab a handful of breadcrumbs and squeeze very gently to remove excess
          milk. Repeat with remaining breadcrumbs, transfer breadcrumbs to
          ground chuck mixture, and discard excess milk. Stir ground chuck
          mixture until evenly combined.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Turn chuck mixture out into prepared baking dish, and shape meat into
          a 3x4x10-inch meatloaf. Pour tomato sauce over the loaf and into the
          bottom of the dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1
          hour 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
          should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let meatloaf rest
          for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
