    <p>
      Perfectly barbecued butter chicken, with a type of vinegar and spices
      marinade made popular by decades of firehouse fundraisers, uses butter for
      extra richness. In this video you will learn how to cut a whole chicken in
      half, how to prepare chicken for marinating, and how to partially bake
      chicken before grilling, and many more techniques to refine your
      barbecuing.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or about 1 teaspoon per pound of chicken</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 whole chicken, halved or quartered</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Add water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic
        powder, poultry seasoning, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and butter to a
        saucepan. Place over medium heat until butter is halfway melted; turn
        off heat, and whisk until butter disappears. Let marinade cool to room
        temperature, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut chicken into halves or quarters and place in a resealable plastic
        bag. Whisk cooled marinade thoroughly and pour into the bag. Squeeze out
        air and seal tightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to overnight,
        turning the bag occasionally. (At this point, chicken is ready to be
        roasted or grilled. What follows are instructions for partially baking
        chicken, then finishing on the grill.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place chicken pieces,
        skin side up, in a baking dish; pour in all of the marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. (At this point, the partially
        baked chicken can be transferred to a plate and refrigerated until ready
        to finish cooking on a grill, or you can proceed immediately with
        grilling.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare an outdoor grill with charcoal. Coals should be hot and white,
        without active flame. Alternately, preheat a gas grill for medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour marinade into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Set
        aside to use as a basting sauce and finishing sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken on the grill, skin side down. Cook over hot coals with
        the cover on, adjusting the vents to keep the heat down, until skin has
        a little color, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue to cook, turning
        occasionally, basting with sauce each time, 10 to 20 minutes more. The
        majority of the cooking takes place with the chicken skin side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        For perfectly cooked breasts, pull breasts off the grill when the
        internal temperature, measured with an instant-read thermometer, reaches
        at least 150 degrees F (66 degrees C). For perfectly cooked leg
        sections, pull off the grill at 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Tent
        chicken with foil; rest for 5 to 10 minutes. The internal temperature
        will continue to rise.
